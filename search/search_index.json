About Alt Markets Alt Markets is a protocol that enables anyone to launch & trade synthetic markets. Markets are infinite, anything that fits into 1-32 characters. Users can long/short any market by tranferring ETH/BNB/MATIC/AVAX. Why Another DEX Protocol? People like to trade. People like markets with good liquidity. People don't like rugs and scams. We've built a new protocol because we didn't find an existing protocol that solves all of these problems. Make your first trade to see how simple it is. The Protocol Alt Markets is a novel DEX protocol that enables users to create and trade synthetic markets with deep liquidity. Markets for Anything You can create markets for any idea and concept - you'll have a tradable market live within a few minutes. System Liquidity Markets are fully decentralized contracts with system-backed liquidity (no possibility of rugs & scams). Trade Easily Search for an existing market, or create a new market by making the first transfer. It's super simple.

Users can open a position on markets by transferring ETH/MATIC/BNB on one of the supported chains (Eth, Bsc, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche). A position can be closed anytime to return the new position value at market price. Transfers incur a fee of 0.5-1% to prevent market manipulation and fund development. Markets are fully decentralized, and cross-chain transfers are confirmed & sent automatically within 2-5 minutes. What is a Market? Markets are 1-32 character identifiers, in categories such as coins /bitcoin, memes /doge, concepts /artificial-intelligence, people /elon-musk, politics /donald-trump, economy /inflation, sports /argentina, and so on. If a market doesn't exist yet, a new one is automatically created when someone opens a position for an identifier. How to create a Market?

Like Uniswap, the Alt Markets protocol uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) function (modified to support bidirectional trades). Alt Markets uses the XYK model to support long and short positions (compared to Uniswap, which currently supports only long positions). Furthermore, Alt Markets uses a combination of virtual and real liquidity to improve the user-experience for traders. New Markets When a user creates a new market, it is initialized with a static base liquidity ranging from hundreds to thousands of Dollars. This is dependent on the current system configuration. Continuous Liquidity Once trades are executed, each trade adds a reserve percentage to liquidity. When a trade is closed, the temporary liquidity reserve is removed and returned to the owner. The flexible liquidity approach is used to preserve volatility, independent of how much volume is traded. A benefit of continuous liquidity is that markets won't stop trading if a large trader (e.g., the market creator) removes their share of liquidity. A market without flexible reserve liquidity would be either too volatile if there is too little base liquidity or too stable if there is too much base liquidity. The Alt Markets liquidity mechanism (combining base liquidity with dynamic reserve liquidities) presents a good trade-off between volatility and price stability to support large trades. Virtual liquidity solves the cold start problem for early markets, and makes any newly launched market instantly tradable. Benefits Infinite Markets Markets on Alt Markets cannot rug or close due to the base liquidity. Since every open trade contributes to the liquidity of a market, markets trade indefinitely and are not stopped when a significant position exits. Dynamic Liquidity Liquidity for markets is dynamic and flexible. This allows markets to start small, with small positions (e.g., $100) making a noticeable price difference. When markets grow to a larger open interest (e.g., $10,000 or $100,000), markets remain liquid and provide good volatility/trade absorption.","title":"Liquidity"},{"location":"liquidity/#liquidity","text":"Liquidity on Alt Markets is based on a novel mechanism and supports all decentralized markets on Alt Markets.

However, all our milestones and goals are guided by a single mission, enabling crypto traders to place directional bets on any concept & idea while making crypto trading more fun. 2023 Milestones Active Traders The primary milestone is to increase active traders using the Alt Markets Protocol via trading incentives. Cross-Chain Bridge We will release a cross-chain bridge to swap AMX tokens between all supported networks (ETH, Arbitrum, and others). Wide Network Support We want to make the trading experience using the AMX protocol as simple as possible by supporting 5+ popular EVM chains. Lightning Integration We will release a Bitcoin Lightning Network integration for Alt Markets. We love Bitcoin and want to facilitate its adoption. 2024 Milestones Promo & Marketing We will focus on various marketing & promo events throughout 2024 to promote the use case for Alt Markets. AMX Ambassadors We plan to build a network of ambassadors for Alt Markets to help promote Alt Markets and spread the word. Referral System We will implement a referral system in parallel to building the AMX ambassador network to increase incentives to trade on Alt Markets. Revenue Share Alt Markets earns 0.5-1% from each transfer, and we want to start sharing revenue with all AMX token holders after the initial growth phase. 2025 & Beyond Partnerships We will focus on partnerships & collaborations that add value to both sides (exchanges, similar protocols, horizontal/vertical integrations). Leveraged Trading We plan to release various protocol improvements, primarily focused on leveraged positions. Lightning Network By 2025, we expect the Lightning Network & Bitcoin usage to exceed any other EVM chain. We will port all common AMX use cases to Bitcoin. Community Not exclusive to 2025, but we will launch various community events, airdrops, and trading incentives to grow the AMX community.","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"roadmap/#vision","text":"Individual milestones on the following roadmap might change depending on demand, suggestions, and the overall market situation.
