Users can open a position on markets by transferring ETH/MATIC/BNB on one of the supported chains (Eth, Bsc, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche). A position can be closed anytime to return the new position value at market price. Transfers incur a fee of 0.5-1% to prevent market manipulation and fund development. Markets are fully decentralized, and cross-chain transfers are confirmed & sent automatically within 2-5 minutes. What is a Market? Markets are 1-32 character identifiers, in categories such as coins /bitcoin, memes /doge, concepts /artificial-intelligence, people /elon-musk, politics /donald-trump, economy /inflation, sports /argentina, and so on. If a market doesn't exist yet, a new one is automatically created when someone opens a position for an identifier. How to create a Market? You can create a market by visiting alt.markets/MARKET with the desired market identifier (1-32 chars). Once you make the first transfer, the new market is automatically initialized and becomes tradable by anyone.","title":"Execution"},{"location":"execution/#how-does-it-work","text":"Users can open a position on markets by transferring ETH/MATIC/BNB on one of the supported chains (Eth, Bsc, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche).
