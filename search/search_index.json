About Alt Markets Alt Markets is a protocol that enables anyone to launch & trade synthetic markets. Markets are infinite, anything that fits into 1-32 characters. Users can long/short any market by tranferring ETH/BNB/MATIC/AVAX. Why Another DEX Protocol? People like to trade. People like markets with good liquidity. People don't like rugs and scams. We've built a new protocol because we didn't find an existing protocol that solves all of these problems. Make your first trade to see how simple it is. The Protocol Alt Markets is a novel DEX protocol that enables users to create and trade synthetic markets with deep liquidity. Markets for Anything You can create markets for any idea and concept - you'll have a tradable market live within a few minutes.

Users can open a position on markets by transferring ETH/MATIC/BNB on one of the supported chains (Eth, Bsc, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche). A position can be closed anytime to return the new position value at market price. Transfers incur a fee of 0.5-1% to prevent market manipulation and fund development. Markets are fully decentralized, and cross-chain transfers are confirmed & sent automatically within 2-5 minutes. What is a Market? Markets are 1-32 character identifiers, in categories such as coins /bitcoin, memes /doge, concepts /artificial-intelligence, people /elon-musk, politics /donald-trump, economy /inflation, sports /argentina, and so on. If a market doesn't exist yet, a new one is automatically created when someone opens a position for an identifier. How to create a Market? You can create a market by visiting alt.markets/MARKET with the desired market identifier (1-32 chars).

Like Uniswap, the Alt Markets protocol uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) function (modified to support bidirectional trades). Alt Markets uses the XYK model to support long and short positions (compared to Uniswap, which currently supports only long positions). New Markets When a user creates a new market, it is initialized with a static base liquidity ranging from hundreds to thousands of Dollars. This is dependent on the current system configuration. Continuous Liquidity Once trades are executed, each trade adds a reserve percentage to liquidity. When a trade is closed, the temporary liquidity reserve is removed and returned to the owner. The flexible liquidity approach is used to preserve volatility, independent of how much volume is traded. A benefit of continuous liquidity is that markets won't stop trading if a large trader (e.g., the market creator) removes their share of liquidity. A market without flexible reserve liquidity would be either too volatile if there is too little base liquidity or too stable if there is too much base liquidity. The Alt Markets liquidity mechanism (combining base liquidity with dynamic reserve liquidities) presents a good trade-off between volatility and price stability to support large trades. Benefits Infinite Markets Markets on Alt Markets cannot rug or close due to the base liquidity. Since every open trade contributes to the liquidity of a market, markets trade indefinitely and are not stopped when a significant position exits. Dynamic Liquidity Liquidity for markets is dynamic and flexible. This allows markets to start small, with small positions (e.g., $100) making a noticeable price difference. When markets grow to a larger open interest (e.g., $10,000 or $100,000), markets remain liquid and provide good volatility/trade absorption.","title":"Liquidity"},{"location":"liquidity/#liquidity","text":"Liquidity on Alt Markets is based on a novel mechanism and supports all decentralized markets on Alt Markets.
