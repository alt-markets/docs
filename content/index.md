## About Alt Markets
Alt Markets is a protocol that enables anyone to launch & trade synthetic markets. Markets are infinite, anything that fits into 1-32 characters. Users can long/short any market by tranferring ETH/BNB/MATIC/AVAX.

## Why Another DEX Protocol?
People like to trade. People like markets with good liquidity. People don't like rugs and scams. We've built a new protocol because we didn't find an existing protocol that solves all of these problems. Make your first trade to see how simple it is.

## The Protocol
Alt Markets is a novel DEX protocol that enables users to create and trade synthetic markets with deep liquidity.

## Markets for Anything
You can create markets for any idea and concept - you'll have a tradable market live within a few minutes.

## System Liquidity
Markets are fully decentralized contracts with system-backed liquidity (no possibility of rugs & scams).

## Trade Easily
Search for an existing market, or create a new market by making the first transfer. It's super simple.
