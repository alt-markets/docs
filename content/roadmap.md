# Vision
Individual milestones on the following roadmap might change depending on demand, suggestions, and the overall market situation. However, all our milestones and goals are guided by a single mission, enabling crypto traders to place directional bets on any concept & idea while making crypto trading more fun.

## 2023 Milestones
### Active Traders
The primary milestone is to increase active traders using the Alt Markets Protocol via trading incentives.

### Cross-Chain Bridge
We will release a cross-chain bridge to swap AMX tokens between all supported networks (ETH, Arbitrum, and others).

### Wide Network Support
We want to make the trading experience using the AMX protocol as simple as possible by supporting 5+ popular EVM chains.

### Lightning Integration
We will release a Bitcoin Lightning Network integration for Alt Markets. We love Bitcoin and want to facilitate its adoption.

## 2024 Milestones
### Promo & Marketing
We will focus on various marketing & promo events throughout 2024 to promote the use case for Alt Markets.

### AMX Ambassadors
We plan to build a network of ambassadors for Alt Markets to help promote Alt Markets and spread the word.

### Referral System
We will implement a referral system in parallel to building the AMX ambassador network to increase incentives to trade on Alt Markets.

### Revenue Share
Alt Markets earns 0.5-1% from each transfer, and we want to start sharing revenue with all AMX token holders after the initial growth phase.

## 2025 & Beyond
### Partnerships
We will focus on partnerships & collaborations that add value to both sides (exchanges, similar protocols, horizontal/vertical integrations).

### Leveraged Trading
We plan to release various protocol improvements, primarily focused on leveraged positions.

### Lightning Network
By 2025, we expect the Lightning Network & Bitcoin usage to exceed any other EVM chain. We will port all common AMX use cases to Bitcoin.

### Community
Not exclusive to 2025, but we will launch various community events, airdrops, and trading incentives to grow the AMX community.
